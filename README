OLIMEX STM32-E407 modified to fit under the 10x10cm PCB size limit that is common with PCB batch services such as Itead Studio and Seeed Studios.

- Moved the 3 BOOT headers inwards
- Rotated the BOOT UART port 180 to allow better trace placement
- Moved traces around the BOOT headers away from the PCB edge
- Moved the resistors on the BOOT pins to allow for the new placement of the headers
